# **1. Research Background and Objective**

## **1-1. Research Background**

- **Growing Complexity and Performance Demands of Modern Web Applications**
    - Increased performance requirements due to real-time data processing and handling large-scale user interactions
    - The need for low latency and high responsiveness to enhance user experience

---

### **Performance Demands**

- **Real-Time Data Processing and Large-Scale User Interaction**:  
    - Today’s web applications need to support real-time updates and interactions with many users at once, like social media platforms where posts and comments must instantly reflect for other users.
    - **Performance Impact**: Slow server response leads to degraded user experience, highlighting the need for a highly scalable backend framework.

---

- **Limitations of Existing Backend Frameworks**
    - **Performance Issues**: Frameworks based on interpreted languages face inherent performance limitations
    - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Memory management issues and runtime security risks in existing frameworks

---

### **Existing Framework Issues**

- **Node.js** and **Python-based frameworks** like **Express.js** and **Django** suffer from lower performance compared to native languages due to interpreter overhead.  
- **PHP-based frameworks** like **Laravel** face memory management problems, while **Rust** can prevent these issues through its ownership model, and **WASM** strengthens security by running in a sandbox environment.

---

- **The Need for a Cost-Effective, High-Performance Framework**
    - The increasing complexity of the web environment leads to heavier server loads
    - Optimized resource usage is necessary to reduce cloud computing costs

---

### **Cost-Effective Solutions**

- As cloud services charge based on resource usage, high-efficiency frameworks that minimize CPU and memory usage are crucial.  
- **Rust and WASM** offer native-level performance and lower memory consumption, providing a clear advantage in reducing operational costs in cloud environments.

---

## **1-2. Research Objective**

- **Proposal of a Modular Web Backend Framework Combining WASM and Rust**
    - The goal is to develop a framework that provides high performance and memory safety while also being modular for improved scalability and maintainability.

---

    - They provide the structure necessary for web application development  
    - Offer common functionalities (e.g., routing, session management, authentication), increasing development efficiency

---

### **Importance of Modern Web Development**

- Web frameworks enhance development speed, ensure maintainability, and establish standardized development practices, which are crucial in large projects or collaborative environments.

---

### **2-1-2. Concept and Runtime of WebAssembly (WASM)**

- **WASM Fundamentals**: A binary format that runs in a stack-based virtual machine  
- **Execution of C, C++, and Rust Code**: WASM allows native-like performance in both browsers and server environments

---

- **WASM Runtime Environment**:  
    - Browsers come with built-in WASM engines, enabling seamless execution of WASM code  
    - Server-side runtimes like **Wasmtime** and **Wasmer** extend WASM’s utility to backend services, allowing high-performance code execution without platform dependencies.

---

### **2-1-3. Features and Advantages of Rust**

- **Memory Safety**:  
    - Rust manages memory through its **ownership model**, preventing memory leaks and ensuring safe memory access, which eliminates runtime errors.
- **High Performance**:  
    - Rust compiles to native machine code, offering performance comparable to C/C++.
- **Stability**:  
    - Rust’s compiler enforces strict checks, preventing errors and improving code quality and maintainability.
